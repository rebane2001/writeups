weird bun shell chall

we ran these commands:
- `touch1<sed\t-i\tsz.......zz\tlol`
  - touch a file called (the equivalent of) `sed -i s/.......// lol`
- `ls1<fix`
  - put the contents of the folder (the sed filename from above) into a file called `fix`
- `/readflag1<lol`
  - run `/readflag` and put result (`Usage: /readflag give me the flag`) into file called `lol`
- `bash<fix`
  - run the `fix` file in bash (the sed command to remove `Usage: `)
- `bash<lol`
  - run the fixed `lol` file in bash (reads the flag)
